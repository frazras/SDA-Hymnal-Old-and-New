So many talents wasted!<br/>
So few bright laurels won!<br/>

And with that sorrow mingling,<br/>
A steadfast faith, and sure,<br/>
And love so deep and fervent,<br/>
For Thee to make it pure,<br/>
In Thy dear presence finding<br/>
The pardon that we need,<br/>
And then the peace so lasting-<br/>
Celestial peace indeed.<br/>

Here are symbols to remind us<br/>
Of our lifelong need of grace;<br/>
Here are table, font and pulpit;<br/>
Here the Word has central place.<br/>
Here in honesty of preaching,<br/>
Here in silence, as in speech,<br/>
Here in newness and renewal,<br/>
God the Spirit comes to each.<br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
Here our children find a welcome<br/>
In the Shepherd’s flock and fold.<br/>
Here, as bread and wine are taken,<br/>
Christ sustains us, as of old.<br/>
Here the servants of the Servant<br/>
Seek in worship to explore<br/>
What it means in daily living<br/>
To believe and to adore.<br/>

Lord of all, Church and Kingdom,<br/>
In an age of change and doubt,<br/>
Keep us faithful to the Gospel,<br/>
Help us work your purpose out.<br/>
Here, in this day’s dedication,<br/>
All we have to give, receive:<br/>
We, who cannot live without you,<br/>
We adore you! We believe!<br/>

Before Jehovah’s awful throne,<br/>
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;<br/>
Know that the Lord is God alone;<br/>
He can create, and He destroy.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
His sovereign power, without our aid,<br/>
Made us of clay, and formed us men;<br/>
And when like wandering sheep we strayed,<br/>
He brought us to His fold again.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
We’ll crowd His gates with thankful songs,<br/>
High as the heavens our voices raise;<br/>
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,<br/>
Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
Wide as the world is His command,<br/>
Vast as Eternity His love;<br/>
Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,<br/>
When rolling years shall cease to move.<br/>

Wrestling with the evil powers,<br/>

Gloom around You and within,<br/>
Till th’appointed time is nigh,<br/>
Till the Lamb of God may die.<br/>

Hark, that cry that peals aloud<br/>
Upward through the whelming cloud!<br/>
You, the Father’s only Son,<br/>
You, His own anointed one,<br/>
You are asking- can it be?<br/>
"Why have You forsaken Me?"<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
Lord, should fear and anguish roll<br/>
Darkly o’er our sinful soul,<br/>
You, who once were thus bereft<br/>
That Your own might ne’er be left,<br/>
Teach us by that bitter cry<br/>
In the gloom to know You nigh.<br/>

My Savior’s love to me,<br/>

Themselves displease, and ’gainst Him rise.<br/>

Yet cheerful He to suff’ring goes,<br/>
That He His foes from thence might free.<br/>

Here might I stay and sing,<br/>
No story so divine:<br/>
Never was love, dear King,<br/>
Never was grief like Thine!<br/>

I all my days could gladly spend.<br/>

When Jesus comes in glory,<br/>
As Lord and King of kings,<br/>
O what a wondrous story<br/>
The blessed Bible brings:<br/>
His face will shine like sunlight,<br/>
His head be white as snow,<br/>
His eyes like flaming firelight,<br/>
His feet like brass aglow.<br/>

Will reach with mighty sound<br/>
Into the deepest quarters<br/>
Of all creation round;<br/>
And at this wondrous greeting<br/>
The dead in Christ shall rise,<br/>
Their Lord and Savior meeting<br/>
In glory in the skies.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
And we who are believing<br/>
And His appearing love,<br/>
Shall know we are receiving<br/>
His glory from above;<br/>
His resurrection power<br/>
Will raise us to the place<br/>
Where we that wondrous hour<br/>
Shall see Him face to face.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
O hasten Thine appearing,<br/>
Thou bright and Morning Star!<br/>
Lord, may we soon be hearing<br/>
The trumpet sound afar;<br/>
Thy people all are yearning<br/>
To be Thy raptured bride,<br/>
And at Thine own returning<br/>
Be caught up to Thy side.<br/>

<h3><b>255 - I Cannot Tell Why</b></h3>

<b><font color=#CD9B1D>hymn_key_note</font></b><br/><br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>1</b></font><br/>
I cannot tell why He whom angels worship<br/>
Should set His love upon the souls of men,<br/>
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,<br/>
To bring them back, they know not how nor when.<br/>
But this I know that He was born of Mary<br/>
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,<br/>
And that He lived at Nazareth and labored;<br/>
And so the Savior, Savior of the world, has come.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
I cannot tell how silently He suffered<br/>
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,<br/>
Nor how His heart upon the cross was broken,<br/>
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.<br/>
But this I know He heals the broken hearted<br/>
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear,<br/>
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden;<br/>
For still the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,<br/>
How He will claim His earthly heritage,<br/>
How satisfy the needs and aspirations<br/>
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.<br/>
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory,<br/>
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,<br/>
And some glad day His sun will shine in splendor<br/>
When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,<br/>
When at His bidding every storm is stilled,<br/>
Or who can say how great the jubilation<br/>
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.<br/>
But this I know the skies shall sound His praises,<br/>
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,<br/>
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer,<br/>
At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King!<br/>

<h3><b>274 - O Word of God Incarnate</b></h3>

<b><font color=#CD9B1D>hymn_key_note</font></b><br/><br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>1</b></font><br/>
O Word of God incarnate, <br/>
O Wisdom from on high, <br/>
O Truth unchanged, unchanging, <br/>
O Light of our dark sky: <br/>
We praise you for the radiance <br/>
That from the hallowed page, <br/>
A lantern to our footsteps, <br/>
Shines on from age to age. <br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
The church from her dear Master <br/>
Received the gift divine, <br/>
And still that light is lifted <br/>
O’er all the earth to shine. <br/>
It is the sacred vessel <br/>
Where gems of truth are stored; <br/>
It is the heaven-drawn picture <br/>
Of Christ, the living Word. <br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
It floateth like a banner <br/>
Before God’s host unfurled; <br/>
It is a shining beacon<br/>
Above the darkling world. <br/>
It is the chart and compass <br/>
That o’er life’s surging tide, <br/>
Mid mists and rocks and quicksands, <br/>
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee. <br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
O make Thy church, dear Savior, <br/>
A lamp of purest gold, <br/>
To bear before the nations <br/>
Your true light as of old. <br/>
O teach your wandering pilgrims <br/>
By this their path to trace, <br/>
Till, clouds and darkness ended, <br/>
They see Thee face to face.<br/>

<h3><b>275 - O God of Light</b></h3>

<b><font color=#CD9B1D>hymn_key_note</font></b><br/><br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>1</b></font><br/>
O God of light, Your Word, a lamp unfailing,<br/>
Shall pierce the darkness of our earthbound way<br/>
And show your grace, Your plan for us unveiling,<br/>
And guide our footsteps to the perfect day.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
From days of old,through blind and willful ages,<br/>
Though we rebelled, You gently sought again,<br/>
And spoke through saints, apostles, prophets, sages,<br/>
Who wrote with eager or reluctant pen.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
Undimmed by time, those words are still revealing<br/>
To sinful hearts Your justice and Your grace;<br/>
And questing mortals longing for Your healing,<br/>
See Your compassion in the Savior’s face.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
To all the world Your summons You are sending,<br/>
Through all the earth, to every land and race,<br/>
That myriad tongues, in one great anthem blending,<br/>
May praise and celebrate Your gift of grace.<br/>

How far from home? I asked, as on<br/>
I bent my steps-the watchman spake:<br/>
"The long, dark night is almost gone,<br/>
The morning soon  will break.<br/>
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,<br/>
With Hope’s bright star guiding ray,<br/>
Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,<br/>
In everlasting days."<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
I asked the warrior on the field;<br/>
This was his soul-inspiring song:<br/>
"With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield,<br/>
The battle is not long.<br/>
Then weep no more, but well endure<br/>
The conflict, till thy work is done;<br/>
For this we know, the prize is sure,<br/>
When victory is won."<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
I asked again; earth, sea, and sun<br/>
Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:<br/>
"Time’s wasting sands are nearly run,<br/>
Eternity is nigh.<br/>
Then weep no more-with warning tones,<br/>
Portentous signs are thickening round,<br/>
The whole creation, waiting, groans,<br/>
To hear the trumpet sound."<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
Not far from home! O blessed thought!<br/>
The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;<br/>
Which oft a healing balm has brought,<br/>
And dried the mourner’s tear.<br/>
Then weep no more, since we shall meet<br/>
Where weary footsteps never roam-<br/>
Our trials past, our joys complete,<br/>
Safe in our Father’s home.<br/>

Lo, what a glorious sight appears<br/>
To our believing eyes!<br/>
The earth and seas are passed away<br/>
And the old rolling skies.<br/>
And the old rolling skies,<br/>
And the old rolling skies;<br/>
The earth and seas are passed away,<br/>
And the old rolling skies.<br/>
<br/>
<i><b><font color=#CD9B1D>CHORUS:</font></b><br/>
O that will be joyful, joyful, joyful!<br/>
O that will be joyful<br/>
When we meet to part no more!<br/>
When we meet to part no more<br/>
On Canaan’s happy shore;<br/>
’Tis there we’ll meet at Jesus’ feet,<br/>
When we meet to part no more!<br/>
</i><br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
Attending angels shout for joy<br/>
And the bright armies sing-<br/>
Mortals! Behold the sacred seat<br/>
Of your descending King.<br/>
Of your descending King,<br/>
Of your descending King;<br/>
Mortals! Behold the sacred seat<br/>
Of your descending King.<br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
His own soft hand shall wipe the tears<br/>
From every weeping eye;<br/>
And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,<br/>
And death itself shall die!<br/>
And death itself shall die,<br/>
And death itself shall die;<br/>
And pains, and groans, and griefs, and fears,<br/>
And death itself shall die.<br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
How long, dear Savior! Oh, how long<br/>
Shall this bright hour delay?<br/>
Fly swifter round, ye wheels of time!<br/>
And bring the welcome day.<br/>
And bring the welcome day,<br/>
And bring the welcome day;<br/>
Fly swifter round, ye wheels of  time!<br/>
And bring  the welcome day.<br/>

<b><font color=#CD9B1D>hymn_key_note</font></b><br/><br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>1</b></font><br/>
Long upon the mountains weary,<br/>
Have the scattered flocks been torn;<br/>
Dark the desert paths, and dreary;<br/>
Grievous trials have they borne.<br/>
Now the gathering call is sounding,<br/>
Solemn in its warning voice;<br/>
Union, faith, and love, abounding,<br/>
Bid the little flock rejoice.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
Now the light of truth they’re seeking,<br/>
In its onward track pursue;<br/>
All the ten commandments keeping,<br/>
They are holy, just, and true.<br/>
On the words of life they’re feeding,<br/>
Precious to their taste so sweet;<br/>
All their Master’s precepts heeding,<br/>
Bowing humbly to His feet.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
In that light of light and beauty,<br/>
In that golden city fair,<br/>
Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,<br/>
And of all its glories share.<br/>
There, divine the soul’s expansions;<br/>
Free from sin, and death, and pain;<br/>
Tear will never dim those mansions<br/>
Where the souls immortal reign.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
Soon He comes! With clouds descending;<br/>
All His saints, entombed arise;<br/>
The redeemed, in anthems blending,<br/>
Shout their vict’ry thro’ the skies.<br/>
O, we long for Thine appearing;<br/>
Come, O Savior, quickly come!<br/>
Blessed hope! Our spirits cheering,<br/>
Take Thy ransomed children home.<br/>

And we know that the goodly land is fair,<br/>
Where life’s pure river runs.<br/>

Their songs are blithe and sweet;<br/>
And their warblings, gushing ever new,<br/>
The angels’ harpings greet.<br/>

With their harps of gold, how they sing;<br/>
Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,<br/>
Of the leaves that healing bring.<br/>

My hope is built on nothing less<br/>
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.<br/>
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br/>
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.<br/>

On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br/>
All other ground is sinking sand,<br/>

<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
His oath, His covenant, and blood<br/>
Supports me in the whelming flood.<br/>

He then is all my hope and stay.<br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br/>
O may I then in Him be found!<br/>
Clad in His righteousness alone,<br/>
Faultless to stand before the throne.<br/>

<b><font color=#CD9B1D>hymn_key_note</font></b><br/><br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>1</b></font><br/>
Come, sing a song of harvest, Of thanks for daily food!<br/>
To offer God the first-fruits Is old as gratitude.<br/>
 <br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
Long, long ago, the reapers, Before they kept the feast,<br/>
Put first-fruits in a basket, And took it to the priest.<br/>
 <br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
Shall we, sometimes forgetful Oh where creation starts,<br/>
With science in our pockets Lose wonder from our hearts?<br/>
 <br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
May God, the great Creator, To whom all life belongs,<br/>
Accept these gifts we offer, Our service and our songs.<br/>
 <br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>5</b></font><br/>
And lest the world go hungry While we ourselves are fed,<br/>
Make each of us more ready To share our daily bread.<br/>

For whom we have waited so long;<br/>
O, soon we shall enter our glorious home,<br/>

Such deep, such unbounded and infinite love<br/>

O brother be faithful! and soon shalt thou hear<br/>
Thy Savior pronounce the glad word,<br/>
Well done, faithful servant, thy title is clear,<br/>
To enter the joy of thy Lord.<br/>

When bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,<br/>
A coronet gleam on thy brow.<br/>
O brother be faithful! the promise is sure,<br/>
That waits for the faithful and tried;<br/>
To reign with the ransomed, immortal and pure,<br/>
And ever with Jesus abide.<br/>

<font color=#0B6138><b>1</b></font><br/>
On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand,<br/>
And cast a wishful eye<br/>
To Canaan’s fair and happy land,<br/>
Where my possessions lie.<br/>
<br/>
<i><b><font color=#CD9B1D>CHORUS:</font></b><br/>
I am bound for the promised land,<br/>
I am bound  for the promised land;<br/>
O who will come and go with me?<br/>
I am bound for the promised land.<br/>
</i><br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>2</b></font><br/>
O’er all those wide extended plains<br/>
Shines one eternal day;<br/>
There, Christ, the Sun, for ever reigns,<br/>
And scatters night away.<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>3</b></font><br/>
When shall I reach that happy place,<br/>
And be forever blest?<br/>
When shall I see my Father’s face,<br/>
And in His kingdom rest?<br/>
<br/>
<font color=#0B6138><b>4</b></font><br/>
Filled with delight, my raptured soul<br/>
Would here no longer stay;<br/>
Though Jordan’s waves around me roll,<br/>
Fearless I’d launch away.<br/>

Pure, unspotted from the world;<br/>
Let Thy Holy Spirit cheer us<br/>
Till Thy banner is unfurled.<br/>

Freedom from all sin and pain;<br/>
Freedom from the wiles of Satan,<br/>
